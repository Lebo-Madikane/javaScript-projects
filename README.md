JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
-----------------------------------------

These are my JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures projects, where I learned JavaScript fundamentals like variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, the DOM and more.

I also learned about Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to fetch data using an API.
